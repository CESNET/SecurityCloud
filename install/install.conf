### Definition of the nodes ###
# Only possible value is a fully qualified domain name. Mapping from the domain
# name to the IP address has to be consistent across all the nodes, i.e. local
# address must not map to the localhost IP address!
node_proxy=proxy1.example.org
node_subcollector=sub1.example.org
node_subcollector=sub2.example.org
node_subcollector=sub3.example.org


### Configuration of the GlusterFS ###
# configuration volume storage
gfs_conf_brick=/data/glusterfs/conf/brick/
# flow volume primary storage
gfs_flow_primary_brick=/data/glusterfs/flow/brick1/
# flow volume backup storage
gfs_flow_backup_brick=/data/glusterfs/flow/brick2/

# configuration volume mount point
gfs_conf_mount=/data/conf/
# flow volume mount point
gfs_flow_mount=/data/flow/


### Configuration of the virtual (floating) IP address ###
# vip_address is an IP address that will be assigned to the interface
# vip_interface and configured with a vip_prefix network prefix length.
#
# vip_address is mandatory and has to be an IPv4 address specified in a dotted
# quad format.
#
# vip_prefix is optional and has to be a decimal number which encodes the
# network prefix length (e.g., 24 and not 255.255.255.0). If unspecified, the
# script will try to determine this from the routing table.
#
# vip_interface is optional and it is the name of the device to add the address
# to. Do NOT specify an alias interface in the form eth0:1 or anything here;
# rather, specify the base interface only. If unspecified, the script will try
# to determine this from the routing table (if vip_address belongs to some
# interface's subnet, then virtual_ip is assigned to that interface).
vip_address=192.168.1.123
vip_prefix=24
vip_interface=eth0
